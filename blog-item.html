					<div class="item-blog__text">
						<p>
							<span class="text-bold">
								Although the concept of Angel investors has been around for decades, it is
								only now that the field of fintech is really booming.
							</span> Although many people talk about the lull in
							markets and recession, and many startups are laying off employees, Angel investors do not pay
							attention to these temporary fluctuations. Their planning horizon starts a few years out, and they
							are
							confident that a sought-after idea has every chance of becoming a profitable business. Moreover, it
							is
							during the fall of markets that investors find many interesting ideas, which during the next wave
							of
							market growth bring them the desired hundreds and thousands of percent return on their investment.
						</p>
						<p>Angel investors most often invest in IT, anything related to the digital economy and the remote
							sale of goods or the provision of services. Many Angel investors have made their fortunes in IT,
							and they invest in an area in which they are very good at. The Covid pandemic has sparked an
							increase in interest in health care startups. VR and AR technologies are also popular among Angel
							investors. It is largely thanks to their influence that the field of AI has developed so much this
							decade.</p>

					<h2 class="item-blog__subtitle">Why Angel investors are so called</h2>
					<div class="item-blog__text">
						<p>Angel investors invest in dozens of promising ideas at once, and only one or two of them make a
							profit. However, the resulting profit is often not even tens, but hundreds of times greater than
							the initial investment. For this reason, angel investors take losses lightly and are willing to
							invest in ideas that seem insane to other investors. Like mythical angels, they help people realize
							their business ideas. Originally, Angel investors were called wealthy sponsors of Broadway
							theatrical productions. At the same time this category of investors is very vigilant and does
							everything possible to prevent their capital from going to crooks. This investment category
							includes both individuals and various organizations. They include foundations, trusts, limited
							liability companies (LLCs) and other forms of organizations.</p>
						<p>
							Angel investors originally appeared in the U.S., but now there are more representatives of this
							category of investors in Asian countries and Israel. Initially, only men mastered this investment
							strategy for themselves. However, now in some European countries up to 30% of Angel investors are
							women. The common feature of this category of investors - they invest in someone else's business at
							the earliest stages. As long as the business is not developed, it cannot qualify for investment
							from
							both venture capital funds and commercial banks. Therefore, without Angel investors, many aspiring
							businessmen nowadays can not do without. It is not necessary to return these investments if the
							business fails, unlike a loan, which has been obtained.

					<h2 class="item-blog__subtitle">How to get in touch with Angel investors</h2>
					<div class="item-blog__text">
						<p>Start-ups can apply to several funds at the same time, led by Angel investors. If your business is
							at a very early stage, it is unlikely to be of interest to large investment funds. Most likely, the
							investor will want to receive shares in the company with the right to participate in its activities
							in exchange for their cash contribution. It is not uncommon for Angel investors to form
							associations which allow them to exchange valuable information and reduce the risk of new
							investments. In order not to lose their money, these investors most often formalize a stake in the
							business in the form of shares at the time of their initial distribution (IPO). It is not uncommon
							for them to have voting rights on the board of directors or other controlling bodies.</p>

						<p>All applications are reviewed by the foundation on a general basis, so be patient. Statistically,
							no more than 1% of applicants receive the funding they need. However, the application process will
							benefit the aspiring entrepreneur in any case. He will develop a business plan, which, sooner or
							later, will give him the necessary contacts with owners of big capital. There are many people with
							valuable connections among Angel investors, so they can always help a promising enterprise with
							advice or acquaintances.</p>
					</div>
					<h2 class="item-blog__subtitle">What are the most impressive grades of Angel investors</h2>
					<div class="item-blog__text">
						<p>There are quite a few examples where an investment in a startup has brought in hundreds or even
							thousands of percent returns. That is why Angel investors especially like to invest in promising
							markets. In the early 2020s, the Indian software market became such a market. Now it is the most
							popular area for early-stage investments, and dozens of rich Indians have appeared among Angel
							investors.</p>
						<p>Angel investors often fail. That is why their activity is possible only in developed markets, where
							investors can defend their rights in court and where the stock market operates. Angel investors
							prefer to act in their native countries, and rely heavily on personal impressions and emotions when
							communicating with startup founders. <span class="text-bold">In this way Angel investors have
								occupied their niche in
								modern business and contributed greatly to the development of the most technological
								fields.</span>
