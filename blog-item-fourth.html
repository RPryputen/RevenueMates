					<div class="item-blog__text">
						<p>
							<span class="text-bold">The year 2022 brought about a lot of change to almost everyone on the
								planet.</span> The economy is
							already going through a recession, people see prices rising, and it seems like it's not the best
							time for investing. But this is not necessarily the case. Today, we will look at things from a
							different perspective and talk about a few trends of investing that could help you save and make
							money in the
							next 12 months.
						</p>
						<p>In the year 2023, just like with any other year, we recommend you do extensive research before
							getting into the investing game. One rule of thumb that will help you to stay profitable is that
							you carefully consider which assets to get. The choice of assets in your portfolio should depend on
							the timing of investment and the budget you have available - make sure you invest the spare money,
							not the funds that you need for life. If you're looking for a short-term return, you might want to
							consider investing in deposits or bonds, while shares might be more effective in a more long-term
							perspective.</p>

					<div class="item-blog__text">
						<p>Now, let us consider a few options that might be popular amongst investors in 2023, as well as look
							into why they might prefer one over another.</p>
						<ol class="item-blog__numbers">
							<li class="item-blog__number">Bonds: quite a traditional approach to investing in bonds will
								continue to be popular in 2023. However, in the next year, it's best to choose them according to
								the degree of their reliability: For instance, in addition to federal loan bonds (OFZ),
								investors should also look at papers, the issue of which has a credit rating on the national
								scale BBB and higher. According to the recommendations of expert investors, it might be a good
								idea to make bonds equal to about 50% of your investment portfolio. That percentage allows you
								to competently and carefully allocate 6-8 diversified bonds with a maturity length of 2-3 years
								from the date of purchase, which will include both OFZ and higher-yielding bonds 1-2 echelon.
							</li>
							<li class="item-blog__number">Funds and index investing: for all those who prefer to trust their
								funds to organisations and reap the benefits - investment funds and index investing will still
								be among the effective instruments in 2023. There exists a huge selection of stocks and
								exchange-traded funds (ETFs) all over the world and you can choose the ones that fit your
								purposes the best. Experts say that the most promising sectors for investment in 2023 will be
								fintech, online trading, cloud services, and semiconductors, as all of these have experienced a
								significant fall in 2022. Therefore, there are likely opportunities for its recovery and rise in
								2023.</li>
							<li class="item-blog__number">Dividends: this year is likely to be interesting in terms of dividend
								yield and payouts. For instance, by the end of last year, companies, mainly raw materials,
								approved dividend payments, and given the strong decline in share prices, the yield on them is
								double-digit. Thus, investments in securities that are predicted to grow can also bring dividend
								yields, thereby significantly outpacing inflation. One might want to pay attention to the
								securities of companies focused on the domestic market, such as retailers and banks, retail
								sectors, and technology companies.</li>
							<li class="item-blog__number">Gold: Just like other precious metals, gold is likely to perform well
								in the next 12 months. This is mainly due to the changes in the US rate cycle. Now, investors
								can diversify their portfolio with silver and platinum, as well as gold, as they are showing
								significant growth rates. However, experienced analysts recommend not allocating more than 10%
								to metals in your portfolio.</li>
						</ol>
						<p>
							Above, we discussed just a few options on how to approach investments as a trader. However, the
							market is not limited to these and it's always best to do thorough research and find options that
							play well with your and your goals. The instruments described above relate only to the stock market
							and trading, but there are also other ways to invest.
						</p>
						<p>
							One such way is investing in start-ups. In the next section, we are going to talk about a few ways
							you can do so, as well as consider the pros and cons of putting your money into a small
							or medium-sized business.
						</p>
						<div class="item-blog__media-ibg"><picture><source srcset="img/blog-item/firework.webp" type="image/webp"><img src="img/blog-item/firework.jpg" alt="firework"></picture></div>
						<p>
							Investig in start-ups works quite similarly, regardless of what funding algorithm you choose to
							stick to. Usually, here's what happens: an investor provides the founders of a start-up with a set
							amount of funds, and receives a share in the business in return. They would also usually have a
							right to claim a part of the expected profit, as well as give business advice (as they become
							shareholders and are interested n business success). However, if a start-up ends up failing - an
							investor is unlikely to get any profit or dividends - that's the beauty of venture capital
							investment!
						</p>
						<p>
							Here are a few ways you can invest in a start-up:
						</p>
						<ul class="item-blog__list">
							<li class="item-blog__item">Crowdinvesting - also known as the joint financing of a project by
								numerous investors in exchange for shares or a percentage of the company's profits.</li>
							<li class="item-blog__item">Investing through brokers - intermediaries between startup
								entrepreneurs and investors. In many ways, it resembles the scheme with stock exchanges.</li>
							<li class="item-blog__item">Investing through a venture fund - in this case, the projects which to
								invest in are decided upon by the management of the fund.</li>
							<li class="item-blog__item">Investment club with partner participation - risks, profit, and
								responsibility are distributed in proportion to the amount of money invested.</li>
							<li class="item-blog__item">Private financing - can be thought of as an investment of personal
								savings in exchange for shares in a startup.</li>
						</ul>
						<p>
							It is important to remember that not all of these options are suitable for a beginner investor and
							that you will need to do more research and consult sources other than this guide.
						</p>
					</div>


					<div class="item-blog__text">
						<p>Thus, investing in 2023 can be as fun and profitable as in previous years. However, in order to
							benefit from it, you will likely need to spend enough time doing preliminary research and creating
							a diversified enough portfolio.
							<span class="text-bold">
								This way, if one asset would not end up performing that well, you
								will still have alternative sources of income and opportunities for growth.
							</span>
